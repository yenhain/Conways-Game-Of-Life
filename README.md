# Game Rules 

The Game of Life is a cellular automaton devised by John Horton Conway.
The game is built on a 2D matrix where pixels can be 'alive' or 'dead'. The game relies solely on the starting state and no inputs.
Each cell in the grid interacts with its eight surrounding neighboursâ€”the cells directly adjacent horizontally, vertically, and diagonally. When the grid updates for the next time step, the following changes happen for each cell:

- A living cell with fewer than two living neighbours dies, simulating underpopulation.
- A living cell with two or three living neighbours remains alive without change.
- A living cell with more than three living neighbours dies, simulating overcrowding.
- A dead cell with exactly three living neighbours becomes alive, simulating reproduction.

- Key p is to pause
- Key s is to save the current sdl window
- Key q is to quit

# Output

Using the SDL, the automaton is visualised and creates interesting patterns.
